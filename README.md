### Introduction

This repo contains Sourcecode written in R and associated documents for the assignment within the John Hopkins DataScience track modul "Getting and Cleaning Data". The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to collect, manipulate and clean an external available data set.  There are 3 files of interest:

1. `README.md` (this document), gives an overview of the files in this repository which describes the steps used to manipulate raw data into tidy data.

2. `run_analysis.R` contains the source code for this project. It has been developed with Rstudio and may be executed without any parameters.

3. `CodeBook.md` describes the variable names of the data set that results from the source code.

### The data set
The data set "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" has been taken from [UCI's Machine Learning Repository](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).
